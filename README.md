# Reverse AIDL tool

This is an extension command to AOSP sources so it has to be build as AOSP source. To build this,
copy or link the repository in the "external" repository of your AOSP source. It will become part
of your build.

# How it works

raidl uses mainly uses Java reflection on the service interfaces to obtain the list of method
supported by the interface. Reflection allows us to obtain the Binder transaction code and the
method they correspond to because the format of the code generated by Raidl is very regular. All
services that use an interface generated by the Android SDK aidl tool should work just fine with
raidl. We also had to include a some quirks for a few well known service in the AOSP because not
all service interface were defined using AIDL. The most important quirks are related to the
'activity' service.

# Example output

```
# raidl iface alarm

// Service: alarm, Interface: android.app.IAlarmManager
package android.app;

interface IAlarmManager {
    void set(int n1, long n2, PendingIntent p3);
    void setRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, PendingIntent p4);
    void setInexactRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, PendingIntent p4);
    void setTime(long n1);
    void setTimeZone(String s1);
    void remove(PendingIntent p1);
}
```

```
# raidl iface alarm -l
Class: android.app.IAlarmManager

   1	void set(int n1, long n2, android.app.PendingIntent p3);
   2	void setRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, android.app.PendingIntent p4);
   3	void setInexactRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, android.app.PendingIntent p4);
   4	void setTime(long n1);
   5	void setTimeZone(java.lang.String s1);
   6	void remove(android.app.PendingIntent p1);
```
