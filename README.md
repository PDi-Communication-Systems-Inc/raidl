# Reverse AIDL tool

This command extends the AOSP and has to be built inside it. To build
raidl, copy it or link the repository into the "external" directory of
your AOSP source. Then go to that directory (assuming you've run
envsetup.sh and lunch):

```
$ cd external/raidl/
$ mm
$ m snod
```

You can then reflash and/or restart and you can use "raidl" on the
command line.

# How it works

raidl mainly uses Java reflection on services' interfaces to obtain the
list of methods supported by a given system service's interface.
Reflection allows us to obtain the Binder transaction IDs and the
methods they correspond to because the format of the code generated by
the 'aidl' tool has a consistent pattern. All services using an
aidl-generated interface should work just fine with raidl. We also had
to include some quirks for a few well known services, most notably
'activity', because the AOSP doesn't necessarily include an AIDL file
for each and every system service

# Example output

```
# raidl iface alarm

// Service: alarm, Interface: android.app.IAlarmManager
package android.app;

interface IAlarmManager {
    void set(int n1, long n2, PendingIntent p3);
    void setRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, PendingIntent p4);
    void setInexactRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, PendingIntent p4);
    void setTime(long n1);
    void setTimeZone(String s1);
    void remove(PendingIntent p1);
}
```

```
# raidl iface alarm -l
Class: android.app.IAlarmManager

   1	void set(int n1, long n2, android.app.PendingIntent p3);
   2	void setRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, android.app.PendingIntent p4);
   3	void setInexactRepeating(int n1, long n2, long n3, android.app.PendingIntent p4);
   4	void setTime(long n1);
   5	void setTimeZone(java.lang.String s1);
   6	void remove(android.app.PendingIntent p1);
```
